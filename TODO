# TODO: My XMonad-related config stuff (Xmobar also)

## Issues
- custom statusbars exitHook sometimes gets stuck (ergo xmonad gets stuck). something fd/fork something

## Cleaning
- ``XMonad/Util/NamedCommands`: unify old command decor/group/etc. types under the (one single) new GADT

## Features to Add (Maybe)
- Action & mapping: find an empty (and unused (in terms of projects etc.)) workspace (WorkSpaceId). Add new workspace if necessary. View it (focused screen).
- Make workspace configuration persist through cold restarts (save to disk)
- Support dynamic per-workspace(/workspace group/project) environments (at least working directory)
